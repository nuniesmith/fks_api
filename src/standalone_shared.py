"""Local lightweight stand-ins for the optional shared packages.

Preference order during runtime (import resolution handled in service code):
1. `shared_python` (new canonical package)
2. `shared_python` (legacy alias – deprecated, to be removed after migration)
3. These local stubs (minimal surface just for config-like access)

These stubs allow the API service to run in standalone mode when neither
shared distribution is available (e.g., ultra-minimal CI or container builds
that intentionally omit the shared repo).
