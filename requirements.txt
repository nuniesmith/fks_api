# NOTE: Local path dependency to fks_data disabled for container build. The relative path '../fks_data'
# does not exist inside the Docker build context (only fks_api directory copied). To develop locally with
# editable cross-package imports, install fks_data separately (e.g. `pip install -e ../fks_data`) before
# running, or multi-stage COPY both folders. Leaving this path here breaks `pip install` during image build.
# ../fks_data
